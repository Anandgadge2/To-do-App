Project Title
To-Do List Application

Description
This is a simple, user-friendly To-Do List web application that allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. Users can register, log in, and then add, edit, delete, and view their personal tasks. The app uses a Node.js backend with Express.js for API handling, MongoDB for data storage, and a responsive frontend built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Features & Functionalities
User Features
User Registration: New users can create an account securely.

User Login/Authentication: Users can log in to access their task list.

Task Management:

Add new tasks.

Edit existing tasks.

Delete tasks.

View all tasks associated with the logged-in user.

Task Persistence: Tasks are saved in MongoDB and persist across sessions.

Technical Features
RESTful API built using Express.js to handle CRUD operations on tasks.

MongoDB used for storing users and tasks data.

User authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or sessions (depending on your implementation).

Environment variables managed by dotenv for secure configuration (e.g., database URI, secrets).

CORS enabled on backend to allow safe cross-origin requests from frontend.

Frontend design with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.

Input validation and error handling on both the frontend and backend.

Clean and maintainable code architecture that separates concerns.

Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, dotenv, CORS

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

Tools: MongoDB Compass (for DB management), Postman (for API testing)
